"""The workflows run in two repositories, and only one of them is this one.

The dev repo's publish script mirrors this directory into the public repo, so
every workflow file here is also a workflow file there — under a different
name, a different visibility, and with no self-hosted runner attached. The
checks below are the ones where getting it wrong is silent: a job that queues
for 24 hours before failing, or a commit quietly billed twice.

This ships, so it is written to hold in BOTH repositories. It asserts the
fallback, never that the run is self-hosted.
