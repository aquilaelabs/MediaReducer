"""The Unraid template as a LISTING, not as a container spec.

test_container_hardening.py covers what the template grants the container.
This covers what Community Applications shows a stranger, and what it fetches
while showing it — a different failure mode entirely. Nothing here can break a
running install; all of it can break an install that never happens, or send
someone somewhere that does not exist.

Three kinds of thing are pinned.

Links that must resolve. The icon and the template itself are fetched from the
published repo by URL, so a file renamed here and a URL left alone is a broken
listing that nothing else notices — the template keeps working for everyone who
already has it.

The dev repo must never appear. It is private. A link to it in a public listing
is a dead end for every reader and puts the private repo's name in front of
them, and the two names differ by one word.

And the warning. Someone installing from Community Applications reads the
Overview and nothing else — not the README, not the dashboard. This deletes
files with no recycle bin, so the Overview is the only place that fact can
reach them before it is too late.
